For this assignment, I learned a lot about debugging complex issues related to dependencies, such as working with external services like SMTP and understanding how to correctly configure fixtures in testing. One of the main challenges I faced was dealing with missing or incorrectly passed arguments to classes like EmailService, which led to repeated errors. I also struggled with ensuring that dependencies like the SMTP client were properly initialized and passed throughout the code, especially during testing with pytest fixtures.
